            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Basketball is a fast-moving court sport played by two teams, typically five players per side, who attempt to score points by shooting a ball through a hoop (or "basket") that is mounted high on a backboard. The game is characterized by constant movement, dribbling the ball while moving, and strategic passing. It is one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports, demanding high levels of agility, hand-eye coordination, and strategic teamwork.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">History and Origin</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Basketball was invented in December 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, a Canadian physical education instructor at the International YMCA Training School (now Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts, USA. He was tasked with creating an indoor sport to keep students active during the harsh New England winter.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Naismith devised 13 original rules, initially using peach baskets as hoops (hence the name). The bottom of the baskets remained intact, meaning officials had to retrieve the ball after every successful shot. The game quickly gained popularity and spread internationally via the YMCA movement. Basketball was introduced as an official sport at the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, cementing its place on the world stage.

            <ul class="space-y-4 text-lg text-gray-700 list-disc pl-8">
                <li>
                    <strong>Game Structure:</strong> A professional game is typically divided into four quarters (12 minutes each in the NBA, 10 minutes in FIBA/international play).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Scoring (Field Goals):</strong> A successful shot from within the arc (the 3-point line) is worth 2 points. A successful shot from outside the arc is worth 3 points.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Free Throws:</strong> A free throw (uncontested shot from the free-throw line after a foul) is worth 1 point.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Dribbling:</strong> A player must bounce (dribble) the ball continuously while moving. Stopping the dribble and starting again is a Double Dribble violation. Moving without dribbling is a Travelling violation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Shot Clock:</strong> The offensive team has a limited time (usually 24 seconds in professional leagues) to shoot the ball and hit the rim or score. If they fail, they commit a violation and turn the ball over.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Fouls:</strong> Excessive physical contact, such as holding, pushing, tripping, or illegal screening, results in a foul. After a certain number of team fouls per quarter, subsequent fouls result in the opposing team getting free throws.
                </li>
            </ul>
