        <h1>The IITs - What is Mean by IIT JEE Exam</h1>
        <p>The Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are the most prestigious institutes in India that offer engineering and technological education of internationally recognized standard of excellence. Over the years, IITs have created a world class educational platform that is dynamically sustained through quality teaching and internationally acclaimed research with excellent infrastructure and the best available minds. Alumni of IITs occupy key positions, both in India and abroad. At present, there are twenty three IITs across India.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>What is IIT JEE Exam</h1>
        <p>IIT JEE is a national level engineering entrance exam consisting of two stages – JEE Main & JEE Advanced. JEE Main is a screening exam to select the candidates who will be eligible to appear for JEE Advanced, which will serve as final exam to select candidates for admission into prestigious IITs. Every year, the IITs conduct a Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) to select candidates for the 4-year B.Tech, B.Pharm, 5-year B.Arch, Integrated M.Sc. and M.Tech courses.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>Pattern of the IIT JEE Main and Advanced</h1>
        <p>JEE Main is an entry-level exam with a lower level of difficulty. It comprises of two papers. The Paper 1 is conducted for admission to Undergraduate Engineering Programs at NITs, IIITs, CFTIs and other prestigious institutions. It is also an eligibility test for JEE Advanced, which is conducted for admissions to IITs. The Paper 2 is conducted for admission to B. Arch. and B. Planning courses.</p>
        <p>At present, the IIT JEE is a single - stage objective type examination consisting of two papers of three hours duration each to test comprehension & analytical ability of candidates. Both papers, Paper-1 and Paper-2 will each have three separate sections on Physics, Chemistry & Mathematics.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>Eligibility for the IIT JEE Main and Advanced</h1>
        <h3>Eligibility for the IIT JEE Main</h3>
        <p>General category candidate must have secured at least 75% marks in Std. XII board exam (with Mathematics, Physics as the compulsory subjects along with Chemistry/ Biology or Biotechnology) or any of the equivalent qualifying exam. (65% for SC-ST category candidates)</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>New Selection Process of the IIT JEE Main and Advanced</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>One entrance exam for admission to IITs, NITs and IIITs</li>
            <li>The new JEE will consist of 2 Tests viz. Main Test and Advanced Test which will test problem solving ability in basic science subjects - Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics. Both Tests will be of 3 hours duration each.</li>
            <li>Only the Top 1,50,000 candidates (including all categories) based on performance in JEE (Mains) will qualify to appear in the JEE (Advanced) examination, which will rank candidates for admissions to IITs, provided the candidates are among the top 20% high scorers of their respective boards in class XII examination.</li>
            <p>As the above selection pattern gives a substantial importance to the Std. XII Board marks, it is very essential that every student prepares well not only for the proposed JEE, but for Std. XII also.</p>
