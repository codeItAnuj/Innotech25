        <h1> What is Kabaddi?</h1>
        <p>Kabaddi is a contact team sport with seven players per side, originating from South Asia, where a single player called a "raider" runs into the opposing half of the court to tag defenders and return safely within a single breath. The game involves strategy, strength, and agility, with points awarded for each tagged player, and defenders scoring by tackling the raider. </p>
    </div>

        <h1>History and Origin of Kabaddi</h1>
        <p>The history of Kabaddi is rooted deeply in ancient India, with evidence suggesting its existence over 4,000 years ago. It is generally believed to have originated in the Indian subcontinent, specifically in the state of Tamil Nadu, where it was known by various local names like sadugudu or gudugudu. The game evolved as a form of self-defense training and military strategy, teaching quick reflexes, muscular strength, and holding one's breath (which was crucial for ancient warfare).

Initially, Kabaddi was a sport played primarily at the village level and was integrated into cultural festivals and local gatherings. There were no standardized rules; local variations existed across different regions. It wasn't until the early 20th century that efforts began to formalize the game. The first set of codified rules for Kabaddi was established in Maharashtra, India, in 1921, to make it suitable for inter-village and regional competitions.</p>

                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Evolution of the Sport</h3>
                <p>A major turning point in the sport's standardization came with the establishment of the All India Kabaddi Federation (AIKF) in 1950, which officially set the comprehensive rules and court dimensions that form the basis of the modern standard style. This formal structure helped propel Kabaddi onto the national stage. Furthermore, the sport gained international recognition when it was demonstrated at the 1936 Berlin Summer Olympics and later included as a medal sport in the 1990 Beijing Asian Games, marking its official entry into major global competitions. The launch of the professional Pro Kabaddi League (PKL) in 2014 revolutionized the sport, turning it into a high-octane, commercially successful spectacle played on mats, showcasing both athleticism and strategy.
