            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Volleyball is a non-contact team sport played by two teams of six players on a court separated by a net. The objective is to score points by grounding a ball on the opposing team's side of the court. Teams are allowed a maximum of three touches to return the ball across the net. It is defined by its core actions: the bump (pass), set, and spike (attack), demanding precise coordination and explosive athleticism.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">History and Origin</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Volleyball was invented in 1895 by William G. Morgan at a YMCA in Holyoke, Massachusetts, USA. Originally called "Mintonette," Morgan sought to create a less strenuous, less physically demanding sport than basketball, suitable for older members of the YMCA. He combined elements of tennis, baseball, handball, and basketball.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                The name was quickly changed to "Volley Ball" after a spectator noted the volleying nature of the game. It spread rapidly through the YMCA network worldwide. The sport made its official debut as a medal event in the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games, solidifying its global appeal. Today, it is governed internationally by the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB).
