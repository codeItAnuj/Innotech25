            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Badminton is a high-speed racket sport played using rackets to hit a shuttlecock (or "birdie") across a net. It can be played either as singles (one player per side) or doubles (two players per side). The game requires exceptional athleticism, combining aerobic stamina, agility, strength, speed, and precision. The shuttlecock, when smashed, can reach speeds exceeding 400 km/h, making it the fastest object hit in any racket sport.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">History and Origin</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                While bat-and-shuttlecock games have existed across Eurasia for centuries, the modern game of badminton has its direct roots in British India. It evolved from a game called **Poona**, which British army officers played in the 1860s. They brought the game back to England, where it was first formally introduced at the Duke of Beaufort's estate in Gloucestershire, named "Badminton House" .
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                The Badminton Association of England was formed in 1893, and the first set of standardized rules was published shortly thereafter. The game spread globally, becoming particularly dominant in Asia (Indonesia, China, Malaysia). It was officially included in the Olympic Games starting at Barcelona in 1992, solidifying its status as a major global sport.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">🎯 Basic Rules and Scoring</h2>
            <ul class="space-y-4 text-lg text-gray-700 list-disc pl-8">
                <li>
                    <strong>The Court:</strong> A rectangular court divided by a net. The net height is 1.55 meters (5 feet, 1 inch) at the edges and slightly lower in the center.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Scoring System:</strong> Matches are played in a best-of-three games format. The first player or pair to score 21 points wins the game.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Rally Point:</strong> A point is scored on every rally, regardless of which side served. This is the modern Rally Scoring system.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Setting (Deuce):</strong> If the score ties at 20-20, play continues until one side gains a two-point advantage (e.g., 22-20, 23-21). However, the score is capped at 30 points (e.g., 29-29 means the next point wins the game 30-29).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Faults (Key Examples):</strong> A fault occurs if the shuttle lands outside the boundary lines, passes through or under the net, is hit twice by the same player, or if a player touches the net with their racket or body while the shuttle is in play.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Serve Rule:</strong> The serve must be hit underhand, and the shuttle must be hit below the server's waist (or below a fixed height of 1.15 meters, depending on modern rules) at the moment of contact.
                </li>
            </ul>
