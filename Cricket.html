            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Cricket is a bat-and-ball team sport played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the center of which is a <strong>22-yard pitch</strong>. The objective is for the batsman to score runs while the fielding team attempts to dismiss the batsman. Scoring and dismissing are done in turns, known as innings. It is a game of immense strategic depth, varying significantly across its three primary formats.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-emerald-600">History and Origin</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Cricket originated in south-east England in the late 16th century. By the 18th century, it had become the country's national sport, thanks to the development of the game's earliest laws by clubs like the Hambledon Club and later by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which remains the custodian of the Laws of Cricket today.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                The international journey began with the first official Test match in 1877 between Australia and England. The game was spread globally through the British Empire, gaining immense popularity in India, Pakistan, Australia, New Zealand, and the Caribbean. The creation of the International Cricket Council (ICC) standardized the rules and governance, paving the way for the different modern formats.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-emerald-600">🎯 Basic Rules and Concepts</h2>
            <ul class="space-y-4 text-lg text-gray-700 list-disc pl-8">
                <li>
                    <strong>The Wicket:</strong> The target is a set of three stumps topped with two bails at each end of the pitch. A batsman is 'out' if their wickets are hit by the ball or if the bails are dislodged by the fielding team while they are attempting a run.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Overs:</strong> A bowler delivers six legal balls (an over) from one end, after which the bowling changes to the other end, and a new bowler takes over.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>How to Score Runs:</strong> Runs are scored when the batsman hits the ball and runs between the wickets. Hitting the boundary ropes scores four runs, and hitting the ball over the boundary ropes scores six runs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ways a Batsman Gets Out:</strong> The main ways include Bowled (ball hits the stumps), Caught (ball caught before it bounces), Run Out (fielders break the wicket while the batsmen are running), and Leg Before Wicket (LBW).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>LBW (Leg Before Wicket):</strong> This is arguably the most complex rule. A batsman is out LBW if the umpire believes the ball would have hit the stumps had the batsman's leg (or body) not been in the way of the trajectory.
                </li>
            </ul>
