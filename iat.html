        <h1>Is IISER better than NISER?</h1>
        <p>The answer depends on a student’s educational aspirations and career goals. Those interested in pure or
            applied sciences and planning to build a career in research should consider IISER. On the other hand,
            students who wish to focus on atomic energy and related fields should apply to NISER through the NEST exam.
        </p>
        <p>As per the latest research rankings, IISERs—particularly IISER Kolkata and IISER Pune—are considered better
            than NISER. However, if affordability is a major concern, NISER offers a more economical option.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>Is IISER better than IITs?</h1>
        <p>The IITs primarily focus on developing engineering competencies and innovation skills. Therefore, students
            aiming to pursue careers in engineering, research, and development should choose IITs</p>
        <p>In contrast, IISERs are ideal for students who wish to pursue PhD-level research and work at leading research
            institutes. When it comes to affordability, IISERs are generally more cost-effective than IITs.</p>
